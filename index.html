    My name is George Ukpong, and I'm currently studying at BYU Pathway. This semester, I'm enrolled in a Web Fundamentals course, where we're focused on building a web page. Creating this webpage is crucial for deepening my understanding of how the web operates, and I've found the experience to be incredibly rewarding so far.
